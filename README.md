# How to build and implement a risk management plan

A risk management plan describes how an organization will manage risk. It lays out elements such as the organization's risk approach, roles and responsibilities of the risk management teams, resources it will use to manage risk, policies and procedures.



## ISO 31000's seven-step process is a useful guide to follow, according to Witte. Here is a rundown of its components:


### Communication and consultation. 
Since raising risk awareness is an essential part of risk management, risk leaders must also develop a communication plan to convey the organization's risk policies and procedures to employees and relevant parties. This step sets the tone for risk decisions at every level. The audience includes anyone who has an interest in how the organization takes advantage of positive risks and minimizes negative risk.


### Establishing the context.
This step requires defining the organization's unique risk appetite and risk tolerance -- i.e., the amount to which risk can vary from risk appetite. Factors to consider here include business objectives, company culture, regulatory legislation, political environment, etc.
Risk identification. This step defines the risk scenarios that could have a positive or negative impact on the organization's ability to conduct business. As noted above, the resulting list should be recorded in a risk register and kept up to date.

### Risk analysis. 
The likelihood and impact of each risk is analyzed to help sort risks. Making a risk heat map can be useful here, as it provides a visual representation of the nature and impact of a company's risks. An employee calling in sick, for example, is a high-probability event that has little or no impact on most companies. An earthquake, depending on location, is an example of a low-probability risk with high impact. The qualitative approach many organizations use to rate the likelihood and impact of risks might benefit from a more quantitative analysis, Witte said. The FAIR Institute, a professional association that promotes the Factor Analysis of Information Risk framework on cybersecurity risks, has examples of the latter approach.


### Risk evaluation. 
Here is where organizations determine how to respond to the risks they face. Techniques include one or more of the following:

### Risk avoidance: 
The organization seeks to eliminate, withdraw from or not be involved in the potential risk.

### Risk mitigation: 
The organization takes actions to limit or optimize a risk.

### Risk sharing or transfer: 
The organization contracts with a third party (e.g., an insurer) to bear some or all costs of a risk that may or may not occur.

### Risk acceptance: 
A risk falls within the organization's risk appetite and tolerance and is accepted without taking action.

### Risk treatment. 
This step involves applying the agreed-upon controls and processes and confirming they work as planned.

### Monitoring and review. 
Are the controls working as intended? Can they be improved? Monitoring activities should measure key performance indicators (KPIs) and look for key risk indicators (KRIs) that might trigger a change in strategy.
